Hi, Iâ€™m Fredy, a Software Engineer specializing in iOS development, based in New York. I have a proven track record of building and optimizing mobile applications, enhancing user experience, and improving software reliability.

At Esri, I developed sample map apps showcasing SDK functionality and significantly increased test coverage from 30% to 90% through integration and image comparison tests. While working at JPMorgan Chase, I improved accessibility by resolving 15 UI/UX and ADA defects in the Chase app and boosted test coverage across multiple SDK frameworks.

I also led the development and launch of GreInvo, an invoicing app, where I optimized performance, achieving a 99.8% crash-free rate and reducing load time by 20%. My technical expertise spans Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, XCTest, Firebase, AWS Amplify, and architectural patterns like MVVM, MVC, and MVP.

### Open to relocation and eager to embrace new opportunities worldwide, I am passionate about traveling, exploring diverse cultures, and adapting to new environments while building innovative mobile solutions.
