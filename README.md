I am Fredy Camas, a skilled Mobile Developer based in New York. I've showcased my expertise through the development and launch of GreInvo, a scalable iOS app. My meticulous design process involved the use of Figma, XCode, and AppStoreConnect, culminating in a successful release on the App Store.

My contributions extend beyond app development; I've also resolved numerous UI/UX and ADA defects in the Chase app, ensuring compliance and enhancing user experience. Through my efforts, I significantly increased unit test coverage, thereby improving application stability.

My proficiency spans iOS development with Swift, Foundation, SwiftUI, Combine, UIKit, and more. I'm also experienced in Android development using Kotlin, and I'm well-versed in Agile methodologies, version control with Git, and continuous integration/deployment tools like Jenkins.
